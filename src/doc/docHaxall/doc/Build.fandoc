Overview [#overview]
********************
Most users should just use the prebuilt [distribution]`Setup`.  However
if you want to get your hands dirty and build from source, then follow
this guide.

To build Haxall from source requires the following projects:
  1. [Fantom]`#fantom` language and runtime
  2. [Project Haystack]`#ph` core definitions
  3. [Xeto]`#xeto` core Xeto libraries
  4. [Haxall]`#hx` repo itself

All of these projects are available on GitHub.

Fantom [#fantom]
****************
In most cases, the simplest solution is to just install the latest version
of [Fantom]`https://fantom.org/` rather than building from scratch:

  1. [Download]`https://fantom.org/download` and unzip latest version

  2. See [Fantom Setup]`docTools::Setup`

  3. Make sure 'fan' or 'fan.bat' is in your executable path

There are cases where the current version of the Haxall repo requires
building Fantom from source.  We call this a *bootstrap* build because Fantom
is used to compile Fantom itself.  See the [Bootstrap]`docTools::Bootstrap`
chapter for details.

Project Haystack [#ph]
**********************
Once Fantom is installed, you can clone and rebuild the Project Haystack pods:

1. Pull the [Haystack-Defs GitHub]`https://github.com/Project-Haystack/haystack-defs` repo

2. Setup an empty "fan.props" in repo root directory

3. CD to your '{haystack-defs}' root directory and run 'fan -version'; verify
your Env Path is as follows: 'haystack-defs (work), fantom (home)'

4. Run '{haystack-defs}/src/build.fan'; should build to '{haystack-defs}/lib/'

Xeto [#xeto]
************
You also need to clone the Xeto repo:

1. Pull the [Xeto GitHub]`https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto` repo

You do not need to do anything else with this repo.

Haxall [#hx]
************
To build Haxall from source:

1. Pull from [Haxall GitHub]`https://github.com/haxall/haxall` repo

2. Setup "fan.props" in repo root of Haxall with this line:

       path=/path-to/haystack-defs;/path-to/xeto

3. CD to your '{haxall}' root directory and run 'fan -version'; verify your
Env Path is as follows: 'haxall (work), xeto, haystack-defs,fantom (home)'

4. Set the environment variable 'FAN_BUILD_JDKHOME' to point to your JDK install

5. Run '{haxall}/src/build.fan'; should build to '{haxall}/lib/'

Note that when building from source as described here, the batch files
in '{haxall}/bin' cannot be used directly.  Instead you can run the Haxall command
line using the 'fan <pod>' launcher like this:
